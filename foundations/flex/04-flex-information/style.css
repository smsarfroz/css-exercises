What do we do ?
I need that title to be in middle 
should I wrap img, class text in a div or something ? 
then manipulate it or flex it as I want ? 
between contents, there is same space and for corner content there is a larger space between it and the edge.
How could this be done ? 
then the text that could overflow just adjusts itself so that it remains inside the content box.
how to do that ? there was a way around, right ?
do I need flex here ? 
maybe, justify-content: space_around? 

is the text inside the box aligned vertically ? 
can I let the box as flex 
align-items: center ?

text is adjusting itself vertically 
so if I give enough margin to the boxes then the text will adjust
